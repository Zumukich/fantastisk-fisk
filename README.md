I created this repository primarily to access all code I create for challenges or training videos from multiple locations. Also to learn about GitHub and the non-coding part of software engineering process.

Feel free to look around, just know that your will find _much_ better versions of whatever I store here on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com).
