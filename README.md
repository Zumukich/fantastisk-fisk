I created this repository primarily to access my own code from multiple locations. Also to learn about GitHub and the non-coding part of software engineering process.

Every piece of code here is serving educational purposes for myself. Most of them are created for [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com) challenges. Feel free to look around, just know that your will find _much_ better versions there.
