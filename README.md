I created this repository primarily to access all the code I create for challenges or training videos from multiple locations. Also, for learning something about GitHub and the software engineering process in general.

Feel free to look around, just know that your will find _much_ better versions of whatever I store here on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com).
